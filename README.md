# Gamifying-Cyber-Threats-to-Critical-Infrastructure
This project aims to raise awareness of cyber threats to critical infrastructure through an interactive training platform.

It uses Mininet and MiniNam to create and display simulated network topologies for different attack scenarios in Industrial Control Systems (ICS).
During these simulated scenarios, the platform provides interactive pages that teach key cyber security concepts and attack reconnaissance methods to the user.

The main purpose of this project is to help provide engaging, intetractive training specifically in the context of ICS for Critical Infrastructure, as the existing offerings
are limited. Most are linear courses that provide little to no interaction and fail to engage users with directed exercises


System Requirements

- Linux is required to run the application as Mininet is Linux-based
- MiniNAM is used to visualise the topology and requires to be run with python2
- All other requirements can be installed using the requirements.txt file.
