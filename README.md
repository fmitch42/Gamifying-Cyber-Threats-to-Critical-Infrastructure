# Gamifying-Cyber-Threats-to-Critical-Infrastructure
This project aims to raise awareness of cyber threats to critical infrastructure through gamification.


System Requirements

- tmux is required in order to run a mininet instance alongside the main application.

- MiniNAM is also used to visualise the topology.
    - One of the requirements Tkinter, requires a specific command for installation. 
        Debian/Ubuntu:

        Python 3

        sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk

    - The MiniNAM.py file included in the repository is also unfit for purpose for implementation in my project
    so I have provided a modified version in my repository
